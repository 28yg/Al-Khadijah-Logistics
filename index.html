                <h2>Air Transportation</h2>
                <p>For goods that are expensive, small and light, and urgent air shipping may be a good choice. 
                  Air carriers charge by a combination of the weight and size of the shipment. 
                  This mode of transport is generally used when speed is more important than cost. Shipping by air is very reliable.  
                  Firms may want to consider the environmental impact of regular use of air shipping.</p> 
                  
                  <p>The airfreight mode of transport is steadily growing. 
                  Also, the airfreight sector is changing direction to integration and cooperation with other modes of transportation such as water and inland carriages. 
                  This action will allow companies to provide services like Just-In-Time. 
                  This is where Al-Khadijah Logistics comes in.

                <h2>Rail Transportation</h2>
                <p>Rail can be a very cost-effective means of transporting goods for long-distance travels. 
                  Goods in containers, 
                  or products that are bulky and heavy are ideal for train transport. 
                </p>
                <p>Well-established rail system can be used to ships products including cars, fertilizer, food and beverages, forest products, grain, metals and minerals and petroleum products.</p>
                <p>Often, large manufacturers locate themselves near rail lines for easy shipment of raw material into and finished goods out of their facilities. Compared to trucking, shipping by rail is very energy efficient, and removes many trucks from congested highways.

              <div class="item-description"> 
                <h2>Road Transportation</h2>
                <p>Demand for drivers continues to increase every year, and the average age of drivers is increasing. The trucking industry will face challenges to make driving more attractive to entice new workers into trucking jobs.</p>
                <p>The most used mode of transport which allows extended delivery services for other types of transportation. For improving efficiency, profitability, service level, and productivity; transportation companies cooperate with fellow transportation companies by creating efficient transport planning, extending portfolio and vehicle capacity, and strengthening market position in the region. </p> <p>This definition is called horizontal cooperation. As road transportation is most used globally by organizations, policymakers insist on shifting companies to more environmentally friendly modes of transportation such as inland waterways or rail carriage. </p>

              <div class="item-description"> 
                <h2>Water Transportation</h2>
                <p>This is a very common way of shipping goods. 
                  The goods that travel by water include chemicals, 
                  stone, cement, sugar, coal and other heavy commodities.
                  The cost for shipping by waterways is economical. 
                  Most low-cost products are shipped by waterways.
                </p>
                
                <p>For the international movement of freight, maritime transport performs a dominant 
                  role in the supply chain. Service quality such as real-time information or tracking systems 
                  is more important than delivery price for the logistics industry. 
                </p>
                <p> The water industry has three types of operation: industry, 
                  liner, and tramp shipping. Industry shipping supplies raw materials like natural gas, 
                  which requires high-pressure containers.
                </p>
                <p> Liner shipping conveys standardized containers 
                  partially or comprising manufactured products from various shippers and different consignments. 
                  Liner Shipping Companies (LSCs), which offer this type of operation, 
                  invest in ships, containers, and cutting-edge technology for improving customer satisfaction.
